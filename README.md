# VoiceSeek

VoiceSeek is a web application that allows the user to look up official album releases for their desired artist. It uses the MusicBrainz API to fetch data and complete requests.

## Installation

No API key or virtual server required.

* Fork and clone the Github [repository](https://github.com/pnw-henry/Voiceseek) into a local machine.
* Navigate to the directory created by using Finder (Mac), Explorer (Windows) or a command line interface:
	On Mac, open the terminal app, cd into voiceseek directory, open homepage.html
	On Windows, open the command prompt, cd into voiceseek directory, open homepage.html
* Open the homepage.html file using Google Chrome.

## Usage

Type in the name of a music artist in the search box, click the search button to find possible matches. If there's a match, select it, and a list of albums from that artist will be shown.

## Roadmap

Implement the ability to sort results.
Add album art to albums. 
Add song listings when a user clicks on an album.
